# CTC-34-LAB

This is a college programming assignment consisting of three tasks:

1. Read a regular expression and generate a nondeterministic finite automaton with epsilon transitions.
2. Receive an automaton such as the aforemetnioned one, so that it consumes a string of input symbols and informs the user the final state resulting from that string.
3. Remove the epsilon transitions from an automaton.
4. Find the regular expression from a nondeterministic finite automaton with epsilon transitions.
